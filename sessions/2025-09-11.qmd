This is the first session of the leadership learning group, where we
will introduce the group, the main purposes, and talk about how we'd
like to run it. I've mentioned the Team Topologies book to several
others at Steno Aarhus, which was the main trigger for starting this
group in the first place. So I thought it would be a good first topic to
discuss.

Since this is the first session, ideally it would be good to at least
read the [key concepts](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts) of this
book or, if you want to buy and read the book, at least the book's
preface and part I's key takeaways. That way, the session can be a bit
more productive.

## Details

-   **Date:** {{< meta date >}}
-   **Time:** {{< meta start >}} to {{< meta end >}}
-   **Location:** {{< meta location >}}

## Agenda

-   Introduce the idea of the group.
-   Discuss what might work for everyone for this group, like times,
    frequency, expectations, interests, etc.
-   Brainstorm any potential topics or things we could read or discuss
    in the future (and put it on the website).
-   Describe the Team Topologies book and its key concepts, and briefly
    discuss them.

## Summary

-   We'll also include articles for reading, as books can be quite long.
-   We'll provide condensed versions of things we're learning.
-   Maybe try to invite others to the group?
-   Agreement: We'll have one meeting every \~10 weeks, for about an 1
    hour.
-   Expectations:
    -   We'll try to get through the one article or chapter or "summary"
        before each meeting.
    -   The person who is responsible for the meeting will lead the
        discussion, but that we don't need to have much preparation
        beforehand.
    -   The person responsible ideally can give a brief summary or
        overview of the article/chapter/book/etc, but no need for
        presentations or any substantial preparation beforehand.
    -   We all want to have as minimal extra work here as a possible,
        while still getting some learning and value from it.
-   Adam will be responsible for the next meeting.
-   What channel to use to send out the resources? Adam will give a
    "menu" at next session and then we will select based on that.
-   Potential topics:
    -   Adam will share what he's doing in MBA.
    -   Daniel will share what he's read about from the project leader
        course at Aarhus University.

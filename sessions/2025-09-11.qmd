This is the first session of the leadership learning group, where we
will introduce the group, the main purposes, and talk about how we'd
like to run it. I've mentioned the Team Topologies book to several
others at Steno Aarhus, which was the main trigger for starting this
group in the first place. So I thought it would be a good first topic to
discuss.

Since this is the first session, ideally it would be good to at least
read the [key concepts](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts) of this
book or, if you want to buy and read the book, at least the book's
preface and part I's key takeaways. That way, the session can be a bit
more productive.

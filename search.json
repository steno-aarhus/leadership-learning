I’ve mentioned the Team Topologies book to several others at Steno Aarhus, which was the main trigger for starting this group in the first place. So I thought it would be a good first topic to discuss.\nSince this is the first session, ideally it would be good to at least read the key concepts of this book or, if you want to buy and read the book, at least the book’s preface and part I’s key takeaways. That way, the session can be a bit more productive."

It will be primarily used to informally discuss and share things we’ve learned/read about or resources we’ve found useful when it comes to leadership. Importantly, this will be a space to critically reflect on current practices and how we can improve things, based on science and evidence.\nThis is mainly a space to share and discuss things we’ve read or learned, that we could potentially apply in our own groups/teams/organizations. This is not necessarily a space about our own individual experiences and how we feel we’re doing as leaders 1. This is about knowledge, skills, critical reflection, and ways to improve.\n1 Though we could organise “peer feedback” or “peer coaching” sessions at some point in the future, if there is interest.The main audience for this group is anyone who is currently in a leadership position or who is interested in becoming a leader in the future. It’s also, of course, open to anyone who is just generally interested in these topics!"

    "text": "Things to learn\nThis section is meant to be a list of topics or things we could potentially read or discuss during the group sessions. As we build this group, we’ll add more to this section. For now, it’s things I’ve read or found interesting that I think others might find interesting too, or that I feel would be interesting to discuss.\n\nBooks\nWhile several of these are aimed at making software, they all contain valuable insights into leadership, building healthy team dynamics, and improving/designing organizational culture. Both software development and research are creative knowledge work, so many of the same principles apply to both domains.\n\nTeam Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow is an excellent book (and website) that discusses effective ways of building teams and getting work done. While the focus is on software teams, the principles are generic enough to apply to any knowledge work.\nAccelerate: Building and scaling high performing technology organizations is a book that provides evidence-based insights into how to build effective knowledge work organizations. It is based on years of research and provides practical guidance for leaders.\nThe Manager’s Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change is a book that provides practical advice for tech/knowledge work leaders at all levels, from managing teams to leading organizations.\nKanban from the Inside: Understand the Kanban Method, Integrate It into Your Work, and Transform Your Team is a book that provides a comprehensive overview of the Kanban method, which is a popular approach to managing work in knowledge work environments."
